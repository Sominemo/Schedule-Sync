# What is a Progressive Web App?

## Intro

Temply PWA (or Temply Lite) — a web app. It means Temply PWA doesn't work like a native app (e.g. "Camera" is a native app) but runs in your browser. In conclusion, Temply works in something like a container.

## Why do we use Web

If we'd wanted to create a native app for each existing operational system we'd made a lot of manually developed versions from a scratch. In that time any operational system has browsers for it and these browsers act mostly the same in different operational systems. It means browsers give us a way to create a single app which will work on all operational systems.

## What is a PWA

PWA (Progressive Web Application) — the way to create and a set of requirements to create a modern kind of web application. Together this two items will help the web application to make it feel like a native one. This way also requires a modern browser to support all brand-new key features.
> For smooth experience we recommend to use **Google Chrome 73+**

## What's the role of PWA for the update process?

Web browsers limit Temply to control the update cycle. In that time this cycle is trackable. It's used by Temply, so it can tell you about new updates. If you've got a "New update" notification there's no way to reverse it. As soon as all Temply's windows will close new version will replace the old one.

## PWA's pros? 

PWA powered applications have such key pros:

- **Fast**: PWA provides consistently fast user experience. From the moment the application loads for the first time, the entire interaction happens really fast. Since the PWA application is fully cached (in contrast to the native sites and Web applications), you can quickly run it. In addition, it does not require a network connection.
- **Integrated**: Despite the fact that the PWA application runs in an isolated container, it gains access to a number of features that are unique to classic applications. For example, the ability to add a shortcut to your home screen and application list itself, send Push notifications, etc.
- **Reliability**: Even if the network is unreachable, thanks to the Service Worker tool that is included in the PWA feature pack, the application can compensate for the missing parts on the fly.
- **Compactness**: PWA applications still inherit one of the most important properties of Web sites, namely the small use of space in the internal storage as compared to native applications.

## What if I don't like PWAs?

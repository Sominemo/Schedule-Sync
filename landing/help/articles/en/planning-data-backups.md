# Backup planning data
 Temply can back up planning data to restore schedules and tasks on any device.

## Backup
 1. Open [Storage Settings](https://app.temply.procsec.top/settings/+/storage) from the menu **Settings** › **Storage**
 2. Go to **Planning**
 3. Click the **Export** button

Save the backup file to your device.  It can be imported back to any Temply supported device.

## Restore from backup
> **Warning!** This action will erase the existing data and completely replace it with the data from the backup

 1. Open [Storage Settings](https://app.temply.procsec.top/settings/+/storage) from the menu **Settings** › **Storage**
 2. Go to **Planning**
 3. Click the **Import** button  
 4. Select a file from your device that was previously obtained from Temply  (**.json** extension at the end of the file name)

You can immediately return to working with the application - the schedule is already loaded.

## Possible problems
### Backup restore error
 1. Make sure that you are trying to restore the Temply backup file.
 2. It is possible that the data storage format has been changed, which is not supported if you are using a preview or a legacy version of Temply.
 3. Make sure that the file was not corrupted during storage or transfer.
